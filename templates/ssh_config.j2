# Configuration data is parsed as follows:
#  1. command line options
#  2. user-specific file
#  3. system-wide file
# Any configuration value is only changed the first time it is set.
# Thus, host-specific definitions should be at the beginning of the
# configuration file, and defaults at the end.

# Global options can lead first, or they can follow after a "Host *" line,
# subject to above weird precedence rules.

# Indentation is aesthetic only.
